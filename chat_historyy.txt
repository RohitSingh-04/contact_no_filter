[22-03-2024 22:00] +91 94566 64447: Dear Team,
Greetings for the day!!

We have initiated the Placement Registration Process for the 2025 passing out batch. Please be informed that there are changes in the Placement Registration process, and we are now utilizing POD.ai for all placement activities. To facilitate the student registration process, we kindly ask you to share the Google form linked here: https://forms.gle/AMJqTi4oAF4AasKF7 with the pre-final year students. This form will collect basic details necessary for setting up their profiles on the Graphic Era Online POD.ai community. It is crucial for all students to fill out the Google form accurately as this information will be used to create their profiles, and changes will not be allowed later. Once the form is submitted, students will receive an activation email from POD via "notifications@pod.ai" on their provided email ID. The email contains an "accept invite" button, leading them to set up their profiles. Instructions on this process are detailed in the attached ppt. After activation, students can access the platform at https://geu.pod.ai using their registered email ID and self-generated password. We urge students to complete the form promptly and anticipate the activation invitation on their respective email IDs. Please note: Kindly notify us if any course/branch is missing in the provided Google form. This applies to all courses, so we kindly request all departmental placement coordinators to share it within their respective groups and ensure that students complete the form. This is essential for the smooth functioning of placements. 
Thank you.

[13-04-2024 14:39] +91 94129 85813: Blood donation offers numerous advantages, both for the donor and the recipient, as well as for society as a whole:

Saves Lives: Blood donation is crucial for saving lives, especially in emergencies such as accidents, surgeries, and during childbirth. Donated blood is used to replace blood lost during surgeries or to treat medical conditions like anemia and cancer.

Medical Check-up: Donors receive a mini-medical examination before donation, including blood pressure, pulse, temperature check, and hemoglobin levels. This can help identify any potential health issues early on.

Health Benefits for Donors: Regular blood donation has been associated with several health benefits, including a reduced risk of certain cancers, such as liver, lung, colon, and throat cancers. It also helps in reducing the risk of heart diseases due to the reduction in iron stores in the body.

Reduces Iron Levels: Regular blood donation helps to reduce the iron levels in the body, thereby reducing the risk of conditions like hemochromatosis, which is characterized by excessive iron absorption.

Stimulates Blood Cell Production: After donating blood, the body works to replenish the blood loss. This process stimulates the production of new blood cells, which can help in maintaining good health.

Community Contribution: Blood donation is a way for individuals to give back to their community and help those in need. It fosters a sense of social responsibility and solidarity.

Safe Blood Supply: By donating blood, individuals contribute to maintaining an adequate and safe blood supply for patients in need. Regular donors play a crucial role in ensuring that blood banks have enough blood to meet the demand.

Raises Awareness: Blood donation campaigns raise awareness about the importance of donating blood and the need for voluntary donors. This education helps dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding blood donation.

Altruism and Satisfaction: Many donors experience a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment knowing that their donation has the potential to save lives. The act of giving blood altruistically can boost emotional well-being.

Free Blood for Recipients: Blood donated voluntarily is usually provided free of charge to recipients, helping to alleviate the financial burden on patients and their families during medical treatments.

Overall, blood donation is a simple yet powerful way for individuals to make a positive impact on the health and well-being of others while also benefiting their own health.

Hello Everyone,
My name is Saksham Joshi, and I am the creator of the SRON programming language and a final year student of BCA at Graphic Era Hill University, Bhimtal.

While working on SRON, I realized that to make it a World-class product, I need contributions and ideas from others.

I am looking for skilled C++ experts to join me and work on this project. If you are good at C++, no matter which course or year you are in, you can be part of this exciting endeavor.

If you are not very good at programming, you can still contribute by helping with testing. All you need to do is write some codes, run it, and share the output.

> Those who join me will receive a certificate and a skill endorsement on LinkedIn. I will also offer monetary rewards for excellent work.

In summary:
    1. I need C++ experts to join the project.
    2. I need people to help with testing by writing codes.

NOTE: Process on this project will begin after July 1, 2024.

If you are interested, please fill out the form.

[28-08-2024 19:15] +91 94566 64447: Dear Students,

We would like to highlight some common mistakes that are often made when sending emails. Please read the following carefully and ensure you follow these guidelines to improve your email communication.

Sending emails without subject line.
Typing complete email in Subject Line.
Sending emails without Signature.
Replying on emails by using reply to all option instead of reply option.

These are some of the examples. So to overcome these errors we all need to work on this. Sharing some of the important tips that you can share with the students.

Professional Email Etiquette for Students
Here are important tips you need to know when writing an email in your professional environment.
 
Include a clear, direct subject line. People often decide whether to open an email based on the subject line. Good subject lines give the reader a preview of what the email is about.
Begin each email with a greeting: Always greet ‚ÄúDear Sir/Ma‚Äôam‚Äù is good etiquette. Otherwise, if you launch into your email without a greeting or introduction you run the risk of seeming impolite or impatient.
End emails in a friendly way: Use ending such as ‚ÄúRegards‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave a great day‚Äù. Even if you use the same ending with everyone, it ends the email in a warm and positive way.
Think twice before hitting Reply All. No one wants to read emails from 20 people that have nothing to do with them. Refrain from hitting Reply All unless you really think everyone on the list needs to receive the email.
Include a signature block. Provide your reader with some information about you, such as your full name, title, course name, campus name, year of passing and your contact information, including a phone number. Use the same font, type size, and color as the rest of the email.
Be cautious with humour. Humour can easily get lost in translation without the right tone or facial expressions. In a professional exchange, it is better to leave humour out of emails unless you know the recipient well.
Proofread every message. Ensure you are using correct spelling and proper grammar. Your mistakes will be noticed by the recipients and you may be judged for making them. Do not rely on spell-checkers. Read and reread your email, preferably aloud, before sending it.

Keep your fonts classic. The ideal font is Arial, size 12 in black. Your emails should be easy for other people to read.

Nothing is confidential--so write accordingly. A basic guideline is to assume that others will see what you write. Don't write anything that would be ruinous to you or hurtful to others.

Use threads: if you get a message from someone and you are going to respond, don‚Äôt send a new message, simply hit the reply option (Avoid using Reply-All Option) on your email, this keeps the original subject line with ‚ÄúRe:‚Äù in front of it.

Be concise: Get to the point of your email as quickly as possible, but don‚Äôt leave out important details that will help your recipient answer your query.

Do not use all CAPS in your emails: This is perceived as yelling in the digital world. If you need to emphasize something, use bold or italics on the points you want to emphasize.

If you are sending an email with an attachment, make mention of it in the body of the email: Write in the email that you are sending an attachment so that the reader knows there is more to the email than just the text.

[13-09-2024 09:43] +91 94566 64447: Dear students,
I have received several queries from both students and departments regarding their eligibility for Vinove Software. Many students, who were previously receiving emails for other companies and meet the eligibility criteria, have not received communication for Vinove Software. Similarly, some students received emails directly from Accenture but are not listed as eligible on the college candidates list and they claim that they were fully eligible and there data / marksheet were  updated in placement cell and earlier they were getting mail .
To help resolve this, I am sending a link where details about these students can be provided. Please ensure the following points are verified before proceeding:
Students should not have any backlogs.
They should meet the required percentage criteria.
Their documents must be updated with the Central Placement Team in Dehradun.
They have been regularly receiving emails for other companies before Vinove Software.
In the case of Accenture, they have not made any mistakes while filling out the form and they are fully eligible and they got mail from company to proceed but not in the college student list.
To take details of candidates the link is as follows kindly share the link to students asap.

[26-09-2024 09:34] +91 94129 85813: *Auto-associative memory network:* An auto-associative memory network, also known as a recurrent neural network, is an associative memory used to recall a pattern from partial or degraded inputs. In an auto-associative network, its output is fed back into the input, allowing it to learn and remember the patterns it has been trained on. This type of memory network is commonly used in applications such as speech and image recognition, where the input data may be incomplete or noisy.
**Hetero associative memory network: ** A hetero-associative memory network is a associative memory used to associate one set of patterns with another. In a hetero-associative network, the input pattern is associated with a different output pattern, allowing the network to learn and remember the associations between the two sets of patterns. This type of memory network is commonly used in applications such as data compression and data retrieval.
